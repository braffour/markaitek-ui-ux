# Goal + Scope
Document Yolo mode UI behavior and simulated agent transcript.

# Architecture Overview (high-level)
- Component state stores user input, building flag, and transcript steps. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.
- Transcript steps are generated by a timed interval. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.

# Requirement → Decision Mapping
- Natural-language input → textarea bound to local state. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.
- Simulated agent trace → interval pushing steps into transcript. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.
- Governance inputs → select/checkbox UI elements with no backing logic. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.

# Contracts (list)
- None implemented. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: define agent API and policy evaluation contracts]

# Data Model Impacts
- Local state: input, transcript, building flag. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.

# Test Strategy (contract→integration→e2e→unit)
- No tests implemented. Evidence: `package.json`.

# Phase -1 Gates (Simplicity / Anti-Abstraction / Integration-first)
- Simplicity: direct interval simulation. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.
- Anti-Abstraction: no external service wrappers. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.
- Integration-first: not applicable without backend. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

# Migration Notes (if code differs)
- None.

# Risks & Rollback
- Risk: Users may assume governance controls are enforced. Evidence: `src/components/views/YoloView.tsx`.
